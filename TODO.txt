Fix running locally - a good test is having a sound resource (wave file) that a model uses that is stored locally, not on animatedsoundworks.com./


1) Fix "Code Capture" for Sound URL's
   a) http... needs quotation in the "Paraters in array form" section


2) Can the "code capture" be saved as a "sound factory" file that can be loaded in to 
a program as a module? It would return a function that can be called to create 
sounds with the specified parameters.

Then the program would not have to deal with the long parameter list. 

Id save the animatedsound model factory as a private vaiable, and return a
function that when called, creates a new sound using the factory, sets all 
the params, and then returns it.
